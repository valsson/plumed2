/**
\ingroup TOOLBOX
Class implementing stopwatch to time execution.

Each instance of this class is a container which
can keep track of several named stopwatches at
the same time. Access to the stopwatches
is obtained using start(), stop(), pause() methods,
giving as a parameter the name of the specific stopwatch.
Also an empty string can be used (un-named stopwatch).
Finally, all the times can be logged using << operator

\verbatim
#include "Stopwatch.h"

int main(){
  Stopwatch sw;
  sw.start();

  sw.start("initialization");
// do initialization ...
  sw.stop("initialization");

  for(int i=0;i<100;i++){
    sw.start("loop");
// do calculation
    sw.stop("loop");
  }

  sw.stop();
  return 0;
}

\endverbatim

Using pause a stopwatch can be put on hold until
the next start:

\verbatim
#include "Stopwatch.h"

int main(){
  Stopwatch sw;
  sw.start();

  sw.start("initialization");
// do initialization ...
  sw.stop("initialization");

  for(int i=0;i<100;i++){
    sw.start("loop");
// do calculation
    sw.pause("loop");
// here goes something that we do not want to include
    sw.start("loop");
// do calculation
    sw.stop("loop");
  }

  sw.stop();
  return 0;
}

\endverbatim
